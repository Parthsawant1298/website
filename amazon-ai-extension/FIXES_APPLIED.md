# 🔧 Chrome Extension Fix Instructions

## Issues Fixed:
1. ✅ **Malformed URL pattern**: Fixed localhost URL pattern in manifest.json
2. ✅ **Service worker conflict**: Removed conflicting onClicked handler 
3. ✅ **Missing permissions**: Added notifications permission

## What was changed:

### 1. Fixed manifest.json
- Changed `"*://localhost:3000/*"` to `"http://localhost:3000/*"` and `"https://localhost:3000/*"`
- Added more deployment-friendly URL patterns
- Added `"notifications"` permission

### 2. Fixed background.js  
- Removed conflicting `chrome.action.onClicked` handler (since we have popup)
- Extension now uses popup interface instead of direct injection

## 🚀 **Next Steps to Get Extension Working:**

### Step 1: Update API Endpoint (IMPORTANT!)
Edit `content.js` line 8:
```javascript
// Change this line:
API_ENDPOINT: 'http://localhost:3000/api/amazon-analysis',

// To your actual domain:
API_ENDPOINT: 'https://yourdomain.com/api/amazon-analysis',
```

### Step 2: Reload Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click the refresh icon on your extension
3. Check for any remaining errors

### Step 3: Test the Extension
1. Go to any Amazon product page
2. Look for the floating "AI Review Analysis" button (bottom-right)
3. Click it to start analysis
4. Or use the extension popup (click extension icon in toolbar)

## 🔍 **If Still Having Issues:**

4. Check network tab for failed requests

## 📱 **API Endpoint Requirements:**
